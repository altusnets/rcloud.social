Getting Started
===============

RCloud supports Chrome, Chromium (the open-source version of Chrome), and Firefox web browsers. Download the latest version of any of these to get started.

RCloud stores user notebooks using either GitHub Gist technology, or using the user accounts on a Unix system.

 * **For the public instance at rcloud.social:** new users must have a GitHub account for [rcloud.social](https://rcloud.social/login.R). Please see our Tutorial, [Anonymous User versus Data Scientist Access](https:/rcloud.social/tutorials/), for information about creating an GitHub account.
 * **For a private instance of RCloud:** new users must have a Unix account on the RCloud system. Please refer to your instance's documentation about creating an account.

Since every installation will be different, please refer to your installation's documentation for any relevant environment information.
