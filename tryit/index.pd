Try It : Online or Locally
==========================

You can test drive the most recent release of __RCloud__ by logging in
to the public instance as a _Data Scientist_ or you can view and
interact with shared notebooks as a _Anonymous User_.  Alternatively,
you may set up a local instance of RCloud so that analyses are only
shared within an organization; see the <a class="blu"
href="#dnld">Download</a> section for more details.


Public Access: Online
---------------------

### Anonymous User (Read Only)

Anonymous Users may view and interact with RCloud notebooks without
having to set up an RClound account.  This "read only" method of
accessing notebooks allows Data Scientists to share their completed
work as a web page with non-developers.  Click on an image below or
visit our [Gallery](../gallery/index.html) for additional examples
that may be found on the public instance of RCloud.
