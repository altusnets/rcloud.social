Try It : Online or Locally
==========================

You can test drive the most recent release of __RCloud__ by logging in
to the public instance as a _Data Scientist_ or you can view and
interact with shared notebooks as a _Anonymous User_.  Alternatively,
you may set up a local instance of RCloud so that analyses are only
shared within an organization; see the <a class="blu"
href="#dnld">Download</a> section for more details.


Public Access: Online
---------------------

### Anonymous User (Read Only)

Anonymous Users may view and interact with RCloud notebooks without
having to set up an RClound account.  This "read only" method of
accessing notebooks allows Data Scientists to share their completed
work as a web page with non-developers.  Click on an image below or
visit our [Gallery](../gallery/index.html) for additional examples
that may be found on the public instance of RCloud.

### Data Scientist (Read/Write/Execute)

Since RCloud has built-in version control based on
[authorized Github gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/),
Data Scientist access is obtained through your GitHub account.
							
Press the 'Log In' button below to access the public instance of RCloud,
or type ['https:rcloud.social/login.R'](https://rcloud.social/login.R) in your browser;
for help in setting up a GitHub account and authorizing the RCloud app,
check out the 'Data Scientist Access' instructions on our Tutorials page.

After logging in, view sample code by clicking on a notebook name
(e.g.,[RCloud Sample Notebooks/Data Analysis/Maps; NYC Taxi Rides/zips](https://rcloud.social/edit.html?notebook=091a719a584a890279065837dbf121ab) ),
view sample notebook results by pressing the 'run' button in the navigation bar,
or create your own notebook using the '+' key in the left windowshade panel and
begin editing by typing code in a prompt cell.

Download: Local Installation
----------------------------

__Local RClouds__ may be created to facilitate collaboration and sharing __within an organization__.
These local installations also come with Guest and Data Scientist access methods.
Details on sharing and security may be found in our [Documentation](../documentation).
Set up a private RCloud by checking out these
[prerequisites](https://github.com/att/rcloud/blob/develop/doc/INSTALL.md) and
[installation instructions](https://github.com/att/rcloud/blob/develop/doc/INSTALL.md)
or walk-through our tutorial [Public Instance versus Local Installation](../tutorials/#PvsP).
