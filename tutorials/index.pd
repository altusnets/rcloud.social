The Big Picture
===============

Why RCloud?
-----------

### Increase Insights on Big Data Analyses through Collaboration

RCloud enables Data Scientists to find value in data by sharing ideas
and techniques with each other and results with any user in the
community.  RCloud employs _notebooks_ composed of _cells_ where
topics may easily be broken up into concepts and where the
relationship between the concepts can be easily understood.

![Searching on RCloud](../images/rcloud_search.png)

In this environment, data scientist teams benefit from easier sharing
of scripts and data feeds, experiments, annotations and automated
recommendations which are well beyond what traditional individual or
locally based development environments provide. Since notebooks are
saved and searchable, rather than spending time "recreating the
wheel", RCloud Data Scientists may reuse notebooks or parts of
notebooks for similar projects.


### Build Confidence with Reproducible Results

Notebooks are project packages which contain all the components and
dependencies of an analysis, including code, data, comments and other
technical documentation, charts and deployment capabilities. This
means results may be be verified and reproduced by anyone with access
to the notebook.

### Engage Users with Convenient Web-based Access

As opposed to analysis which are stored locally, web-based content
allows Data Scientists to collaborate over the Internet without
concern for the location or syncing of system parameters, code and
data.  For example, the public instance of RCloud includes all CRAN
packages.

![](../images/RCloud_WebAccess.png)

Local development environment parameters no
longer create hurdles for viewing and running analyses since RCloud is
platform independent and user access and controls remain constant
which promotes user confidence and engagement.

### Access Big Data Processing Tools and Javascript Libraries using Built-in Features

RCloud supports all R packages including
[__iotools__](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iotools/index.html) for processing large data files
and [ ![Spark](../images/spark-logo-trademark.png){class="tutorial-aimg"} ](https://amplab-extras.github.io/SparkR-pkg/)
- an R frontend for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

An RCloud session runs on both client and server, so it is possible
for R functions on the server to call JavaScript functions on the
client, and vice versa.  This means rich web-based content through
easy integration of custom Javascript user interface (UI) and
Javascript libraries such as JQuery and D3.

### Insure Privacy with OCAP Implementation and Notebook Encryption

RCloud supports efficient, secure, client/server connections via the
FastRWeb package and an adopted discipline known as the
[Object-Capabilities (ocap)](http://www.erights.org/talks/thesis/markm-thesis.pdf).

This means that web browsers never directly instruct the RCloud
backend to execute arbitrary code which prevents unauthenticated
clients from making unauthorized calls to the RCloud runtime
environment; read more about ocap on our
[Documentation](../documentation) introduction page or see the
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model)
article. RCloud also maintains an automatic git based trail of code
modifications which document the development history of an RCloud
based project and RCloud notebooks may be encrypted for added
security.  In the notebook product space, authenticated client-server
channeling and notebook encryption are unique to RCloud.


### Transform Knowledge into Assets with Built-in Version Control

Code, widget, dashboard and analysis libraries are an ancillary
benefit that comes with the creation of every RCloud notebook (on the
public instance or in private clouds).

![](../images/github_logo.png)

These "knowledge assets" may used on similar projects or to train new
employees, for example. RCloud notebooks are searchable and forkable
(sharable), so anyone with access to the notebooks may view and reuse
a notebook and its content or various parts.

### Minimize Development to Deployment Effort through Notebook Sharing


Standard analytic workflows often involve performing a data science
experiment using one set of tools and deploying the results using
other tools.

![](../images/header_sharetype.png)

Rather than stitching pipelines together and/or
dealing with inconsistences between development and production
environments, every RCloud notebook is named by a URL so analyses may
easily be transformed from code and technical documenation to markdown
annotated notebooks or rich web-based dashboards.

### Access Benefits of using Open Source Software


RCloud is an ideal environment for research and data analysis
departments who commonly use R and/or Python to share, publish and
archive their code and data. RCloud is roughly the same in terms of
compute efficiency as in memory Business Intelligence (BI) tools like
Tableau and Qlikview, but unlike these systems, you can add users to
RCloud without licensing concerns.

Open source software also means access free online help and user
training through forums like Stackoverflow.

Public Instance versus Local Installation
-----------------------------------------

### Public Instance

The public RCloud instance is the perfect place to test drive
RCloud. Anyone with a GitHub account can have full user access to this
instance. If you don't already have a GitHub account you can create
one at the [GitHub login page](https://github.com); see the next section
[Data Scientist Access (or Logging in)](#DSAccess) for details.
								
### Local Installation

A local instance has the advantage of granting you complete control of
your notebooks and data. Local instances also afford the opportunity
to evaluate and experiment with the RCloud infrastructure. Windows is
not supported at this time, but the following describes the
requirements for the OSX download:

| Requirements:
|   OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
|   R 3.3.1
|   XQuartz 2.7.9
|   Java 1.8.0


### Local Enterprise Installation

Complete detailed instructions for installing a local enterprise
RCloud instance may be found on GitHub [Installing
RCloud](https://github.com/att/rcloud/blob/develop/doc/INSTALL.md)


Anonymous User versus Data Scientist Access
--------------------------------------------

Both the public instance of RCloud and any local installation come
with two methods for accessing notebooks: as an _Anonymous User_ or as
a _Data Scientist_.

### Anonymous User

Anonymous Users may view and interact with RCloud notebooks without
having an RCloud account.  This is done by navigating to the RCloud
notebook web page using a hyperlink. The purpose of Anonymous User
access is to allow Data Scientists to share their completed work as a
web page (hyperlink) with non-developers and/or users who do not have
an RCloud account.

To find out how a Data Scientist may share their work through
hyperlinks, please refer the the [Sharing
Notebooks](#sharing-notebooks) tutorial.
								
### Data Scientist Access

An RCloud Data Scientist is someone with an RCloud account who can
create, edit, fork (copy) and share notebooks. Since RCloud provides
automatic version control by storing notebooks as Github gists,
creating an RCloud account requires that you have a Github account. If
you already have a GitHub account, you may skip to Step 3.

1) Press the "Log In" button on the [Try It](../tryit/) page or type __http://rcloud.social/login.R__ in your browser.

![RCloud Log In](../images/RCloud_login.png)

2) If you are not already logged into your GitHub account, you will
be redirected to GitHub where you can login (Github Sign in). [RCloud
GitHub Sign In](../images/RCloud_GithubSignIn.png) or you may register
for an account if you don't already have one (Github Sign up).

![RCloud GitHub Sign Up](../images/RCloud_GithubSignUp.png)

...if this is a new GitHub account, GitHub requires that you verify
your email address.

!(RCloud GitHub Verify Email Address)[../images/RCloud_GitHubVerify.png]

3) After signing into your Github account, or registering for one as
 the case may be, the next step is to authorize RCloud to create gists
 in your Github account by pressing the 'Authorize application'
 button.

Note: For new GitHub accounts, you will need to navigate back to the
['Log In'](https://rcloud.social/login.R) page
to get to the GitHub 'Authorize application' page, or you can find it
in your GitHub profile settings.

![RCloud GitHub Authorization](../images/RCloud_GithubAuth.png)

4) Once you have authorized the RCloud application, you should be
 automatically redirected back to the RCloud editing environment where
 you may begin creating and editing notebooks.

Creating, Forking (Copying) and Saving Notebooks
------------------------------------------------

To create an RCloud notebook, you must be logged in as an RCloud Data Scientist.
Once you are logged in, you may create a notebook using two methods:

Using the '+' key at the top of the left windowpane, or

![RCloud Create Notebook Icon '+'](../images/RCloud_CreateIcon.png)

										
Fork (copy) an existing notebook using the fork icon in the navigation bar.

![RCloud Fork Notebook Icon](../images/RCloud_ForkIcon.png)

										
Save notebooks by using the save icon in the navigation bar or by running the notebook.

![RCloud Save Notebook using Save Icon or by Running Notebook using Run Icon](../images/RCloud_SaveRunIcons.png)

Short Time Fourier Transform of an Audio File

Loading and Saving Data
-----------------------

There are several methods to access data in RCloud including the following: 

### File upload to Data Scientist home directory.

Files may be uploaded to a User's home directory by using the GUI interface found in the right windowshade panel.

![RCloud File Upload Example 1](../images/RCloud_Upload1.png)

Note: In this example, the 'Upload to notebook' box is not ticked.

Since the data is now located in your home directory, you would access
the path to the data using the following RCloud API
__'rcloud.home()'__:

~~~~
# Use RCloud API to read data
# Data source: http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/rel/zcta_county_rel_10.txt'
fn1 <- read.csv(rcloud.home('zcta_county_rel_10.txt'), sep=',', colClasses="character")
summary(fn1)
~~~~

### File upload to RCloud Notebook.

Files may be uploaded directly to a specific RCloud Notebook by using
the same process as in the first method, but also ticking the 'Upload
to notebook' box in the GUI.

![RCloud File Upload Example 2](../images/RCloud_Upload2.png)

Note: In this example, the 'Upload to notebook' box is ticked.

Since the data is now an RCloud 'asset', you would access the path to
the data using the following RCloud API
__'rcloud.get.asset()'__.

~~~~
# Use RCloud API to read data
# Data source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo
fn2 = rcloud.get.asset('zoo_data.txt', as.file=TRUE)      
t2 = read.table(fn2,sep=",",header=TRUE) 
~~~~

### Drag and drop files to RCloud Assets.

Data may also be uploaded to RCloud by dragging and dropping files
from your local machine to the Asset windowpane; the 'Drop File to
Asset' GUI will automatically appear as you drag files.

![RCloud Drag and Drop Data as an Asset](../images/RCloud_DragDrop.png)

Note: Using this method, file size is currently limited to 75KB on the public instance of RCloud.

Since the data is now and RCloud asset, it is referenced using the same method as in [above](#file-upload-to-rcloud-notebook).

~~~~
# Use RCloud API to read data
# Data source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo
fn3 = rcloud.get.asset('Wholesale_customers_data.csv', as.file=TRUE);         
t3 = read.table(fn3,sep=",",header=TRUE)
~~~~

### Manually create an RCloud Asset by typing in data.

RCloud Data Scientists may also manually enter data as an RCloud
Asset.  First click on the 'New Asset' tab in the Asset panel:

![RCloud Enter Asset Example 1](../images/RCloud_EnterData1.png)

Type a file name:

![RCloud Enter Asset Example 2](../images/RCloud_EnterData2.png)

Then either type data in the tab or use keyboard shortcut keys to copy and paste (e.g., Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V).

![RCloud Enter Asset Example 3](../images/RCloud_EnterData3.png)

Since the data is now an RCloud asset, it is referenced using the same method as [above](#file-upload-to-rcloud-notebook).

~~~~
# Use RCloud API to read data
# Data source: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
fn4 = rcloud.get.asset('Play_tennis.csv', as.file=TRUE);        
t4 = read.table(fn4,sep=",",header=TRUE)                  
~~~~

There are several methods to save data in RCloud including the following:

### Output Data

Save data in your RCloud home directory by specifying the path:

~~~~
oDir  = rcloud.home()
outFn = paste(oDir,"/outputTest.txt",sep="")

# Write to file
write.table(t4, outFn)
~~~~

### For writing out to binary, the following code would be used instead:

~~~~
# Create the output file; "wb" = write binary
# f = file( outFn, "wb")
#
# Standard R write binary function
# writeBin(t4,f); 

### Some useful commands for data processing are:
1. file.remove(rcloud.upload.path("foo.txt")) 
2. list.files(rcloud.home()).
~~~~

Since Unix user directory may or may not coincide with the RCloud home
 directory depending on the deployment, rcloud.upload.path() may also
 be used.  For example: 'list.files(rcloud.upload.path())'.

This information may also be viewed in the RCloud Sample Notebook:
[  Data - Loading and Saving ](https://rcloud.social/view.html?notebook=9a9f96904f9ddd57656f26206b14e401)

								
Sharing Notebooks
-----------------

RCloud Data Scientists may obtain a hyperlink (URL) to a notebook they
have created or a published notebook created by another Data Scientist
by clicking on the downward arrow next to the share icon 
![](../images/header_share.png) in the navigation bar.

to obtain a popup menu:

![](../images/header_sharetype.png)

This allows Data Scientists to select the kind of URL they would like
to share with non-developers.  The simplest form of sharing is using
RCloud notebook UI "view.html"; make the selection using the popup
menu and then right click on the share icon to copy the notebook
hyperlink. Alternatively, after selecting "view.html" with the share
icon dropdown, click the share icon to launch the "view.html" notebook
in a new tab, then copy that URL to share with non-RCloud Data
Scientists.

![](../images/share_viewhtml.png)

Note: This only works if the notebook has also been published.

By default, users who wish to view notebooks must be logged into
RCloud. However, if the "Publish Notebook" box is checked, __any__
user who has network access to the notebook's URL will be able to
_view_ the notebook.

![View HTML Share](../images/publish_share.png)

Notebook Privacy and Security
-----------------------------

Make a notebook protected (private) by clicking on the "eye" icon next to the notebook name in the left windowpane:

![RCloud Protect Notebook](../images/RCloud_Hide.png)

Protected notebooks are readable only by the owner and (optionally) a
select group of users and will not show up in search results (although
previously unprotected versions might).

Use the second tab of the protection dialog to create/rename groups
and/or assign other users as administrators/members of groups you
administrate. Alternatively, you can select Manage Groups from the
Advanced menu item in the navigation bar — note that the Notebook tab
will be grayed out in that case, as Manage Groups is not notebook
specific.

![RCloud Group Notebook](../images/RCloud_Private.png)

![RCloud Manage Groups](../images/RCloud_Groups.png)


Extending Interaction
=====================

Using Shiny on RCloud
---------------------

This tutorial describes how to write and deploy an 
[R Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application on RCloud.

Hosting Shiny applications on RCloud allows you to enjoy the
convenience of RCloud development and distribution with the elegant
user interface features of Shiny.


This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the basics of Shiny
application development.  To learn more about constructing Shiny apps
or for a refresher on the Shiny architecture visit the [RStudio Shiny
Tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) page.

1) Create a new blank RCloud notebook by clicking on the '+' button in
 the left windowshade panel. 

![RCloud Create Notebook](../images/RCloud_CreateNotebook.png)

2) Put the notebook in the Shiny share mode by clicking on the
 downward arrow in the 'share' icon and selecting 'shiny.html'.
 
![RCloud Shiny Tutorial Share Icon](../images/RCloud_ShinyTutorial.png)

3) Enter your Shiny sever and user interface code. Here is a basic example:

~~~~
  library(rcloud.shiny)
library(shiny)

# Put code here that will run once when the app is loaded

df = iris

# This is your Shiny User Interface (UI) layout
ui = fluidPage(
    titlePanel("My Shiny RCloud Example"),
    helpText(a("View Source in RCloud UI", target="_blank", href=paste0("/edit.html?notebook=", rcloud.session.notebook.id()))),
    verticalLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
        selectInput("src0","Sepal",c("Length","Width")),
        selectInput("src1","Petal",c("Length","Width")),
        hr(),
        helpText(paste("This data set has",nrow(df),"rows"))
      ),
      mainPanel(
        plotOutput("thePlot")
      )

    )
  )

# This is the standard Shiny server function
server = function(input,output)
{
    output$thePlot = renderPlot({

        x = df[[paste0("Petal.",input$src0)]]
        y = df[[paste0("Sepal.",input$src1)]]

        plot(x,y,xlab=input$src0,ylab=input$src1)

    })
}

# Start the Shiny app in your browser.
rcloud.shinyApp(ui=ui,server=server)
~~~~

4) Notice that the Shiny server and UI functions are written exactly
as they would in a stand-alone Shiny app except they are not wrapped
inside shinyUI() and shinyServer() functions. Instead they are simply
passed to the rcloud.shinyApp() API.

5) To run this app first click the play button. Any R syntax errors
will be shown in the notebook cell output window.  If no errors occur
then click the run arrow on the 'share' icon in the editor toolbar.  A
new tab will open in your browser with the executing Shiny app. Any
runtime errors will be shown in the browser just as they would in a
stand-alone Shiny app.

6) Shiny apps may be shared publicaly or privately just like any other
RCloud notebook.  Read the 'Sharing RCloud Notebooks' tutorial for the
details.
